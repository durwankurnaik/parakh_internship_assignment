# Note

- I have updated the json data and added few entries so that UI renders well.
- UI dynamically shows the data from the JSON file and changing JSON file also updates the UI
- As mentioned in the assigment notes, clicking on "add to cart" and "remove from cart" does their respective functionality and displays required data on console
- I have used pnpm instead of npm but npm also works completely fine and the instructions to run project in your local system has been given below
- Tailwind CSS has been used to align the grid system in the main_content component, other than that, vanilla CSS has been used for all the styling
